# File-based import

There's also a nice [File-based import guide](https://support.ynab.com/en_us/file-based-import-a-guide-Bkj4Sszyo) they suggest to read before importing any data.
 
 
## Formats

YNAB supports importing data from multiple file formats. OFX is the recommended one.


### OFX

Open Financial Exchange (OFX) data format.

### CSV

You can import transactions into YNAB using a CSV file format defined at https://support.ynab.com/en_us/formatting-a-csv-file-an-overview-BJvczkuRq.
